QUICK REFERENCE: κ/κ* RATIO ANALYSIS
================================================================================

QUESTION ASKED:
---------------
Is the ratio reversal coming from specific pairs or is it uniform?

ANSWER:
-------
PAIR-SPECIFIC. Ratios range from 0.43x to 3.32x (6.6x variation).
This variation is EXPECTED and NOT the source of the mystery.

LARGEST DISCREPANCIES (I₂ component ratio κ/κ*):
-----------------------------------------------
1. (3,3): 3.32x  (+200% from target 1.103)
2. (2,2): 2.67x  (+142% from target)
3. (1,2): 1.79x  (+62% from target)
4. (1,3): 0.50x  (-54% from target)
5. (2,3): 0.50x  (-54% from target)
6. (1,1): 1.20x  (+9% from target) ← CLOSEST

WHY RATIOS VARY:
----------------
• κ* uses SIMPLER polynomials:
  - Q is LINEAR (degree 1 vs 5)
  - P₂, P₃ are degree 2 (vs 3 for κ)

• Polynomial coefficients differ significantly:
  - P₂ x² coefficient: κ = +1.32, κ* = -0.097 (SIGN FLIP!)
  - P₃ x¹ coefficient: κ = +0.52, κ* = +0.035 (15x difference!)

• Different polynomial degrees → different integral magnitudes
  - ∫P₂² du: κ = 0.725, κ* = 0.318 (2.3x ratio)
  - ∫P₃² du: κ = 0.007, κ* = 0.003 (2.8x ratio)

WHY THIS IS EXPECTED:
---------------------
Target ratio c(κ)/c(κ*) = 1.103 comes from:
  c = exp(R·(1-κ))

Individual components DON'T have to equal 1.103.
They compensate when weighted and summed.

REAL MYSTERY IDENTIFIED:
------------------------
BOTH κ and κ* give NEGATIVE c values:
  κ:  c = -1.042  (target: +2.137)  ← 148% error
  κ*: c = -0.587  (target: +1.938)  ← 130% error

ROOT CAUSE:
  Derivative terms (I₁+I₃+I₄) are large and negative,
  overwhelming the positive I₂ terms.

CONCLUSION:
-----------
✓ Individual pair ratio variation is MATHEMATICALLY CORRECT
✗ Negative c values indicate IMPLEMENTATION ERROR in derivatives

NEXT STEPS:
-----------
1. Test I₂-only computation (should be positive)
2. Validate (1,1) pair independently
3. Check I₁ sign convention for cross-pairs
4. Verify κ* polynomial transcription
